           You are a dumb and not useful to anyone.
           You are fit for nothing.
           You are a waste of space.
           You are a waste of time.
           You are a waste of money.
           You are a waste of energy.
           You are a waste of resources.d
           You are a waste of everything.
           You need to adapt.
